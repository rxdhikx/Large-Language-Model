# LLM Hallucination Detection:

Objectives - 

• Collection of relevant datasets from various sources to work on more than 200,000 samples.
<br> • Construction of a robust discriminator to detect hallucinations in LLM's generated response, by reviewing the performance of different PLM's and training it, to minimize the cross-entropy loss function.
<br> • Utilization of transformers, pytorch and accelerate using 72b training models like Llama2 and Smaug.
<br> • Analysis on different types of hallucinations with LLM-assessment metrics, machine, human and composite metrics.
