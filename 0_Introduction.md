<p>
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened up unprecedented possibilities, but it has also brought forth a critical challenge – the phenomenon of hallucinations. These unintended fabrications, often seemingly plausible, can undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of these powerful models.
</p><p>
Undeterred by this formidable hurdle, I embarked on an ambitious journey to develop a robust discriminator capable of detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated responses. Through a meticulous process, I curated an extensive dataset encompassing over 200,000 samples from diverse sources, laying the foundation for a comprehensive exploration of this intricate problem.

Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of transformers, PyTorch, and accelerate, I harnessed the power of state-of-the-art 72B training models like LLaMa2 and MoMo – the third-ranked model on the open LLM leaderboard as of February 2024. With unwavering determination, I fine-tuned this discriminator to minimize the cross-entropy loss function, ensuring its ability to accurately identify hallucinations across a wide range of scenarios.

But my quest did not stop there. I delved deeper into the intricacies of hallucinations, conducting a comprehensive analysis of their various manifestations. By employing a combination of LLM-assessment metrics, machine-driven evaluations, human assessments, and composite metrics, I shed light on the nuances and patterns that characterize these deviations from factual accuracy.

The culmination of this groundbreaking project is a robust, battle-tested hallucination detection system that stands as a pioneering achievement in the field of LLM reliability and trustworthiness. With its proven ability to safeguard against the propagation of misinformation and falsehoods, this discriminator represents a significant stride towards ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of these powerful language models.</p>
